# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to process and organize Pewlett Hackard employee data to determine the number of employees retiring in the near future. The number of employees retiring was determined by their birth dates ansd hire dates. This data was used to organize employees retiring by their title and also to determine which employees are eligible for a new mentorship program.
## Results
The following conclusions were made from the analysis:
- 90,398 out of 300,024 employees will be reitiring from the company in the near future. This is around 30% of total employees.
- ~32% of those soon to retire are Senior Engineers. This is the majority of the total. https://github.com/jessesingh15/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/master/Data/unique_titles.csv
- 2 out of 5 managers will be retiring. This is the largest portion of a single department.
- 1,549 out of 90,398 employees are qualified for the mentorship program. https://github.com/jessesingh15/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/master/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv
## Summary
- Without any changes to the company structure and total number of roles, 90,398 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to take place.
- Only 1,549 out 90,398 retirees (about 1.7%) will be qualify for the mentorship program. It would be a difficult task for only 1,549 mentors to train nearly 90,000 new hires. Pewlett Hackard will likely have to re-structure their new hire mentorship program.
